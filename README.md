# BossCursor
Boss cursor adds arrows around your character that points towards the boss.

This way you do not need the mini-map open to be able to properly aim.

The size and transparency of the arrow changes the closer the boss is, so that you get a good feel for how far away the boss is, even when it is off screen.

Using the overlay map hides the cursor.
